## How to generate 3D models

### Requirements

- Have [Hunyuan3D-2](https://github.com/Tencent/Hunyuan3D-2) installed locally or have a public API
- If Hunyuan3D-2 is local, you need to install its prerequisites
- Install [UniGLTF](https://github.com/ousttrue/UniGLTF/releases) plugin on Unity to use 3D `.glb` files
- Install Test Framework on Unity for the plugin UniGLTF to function properly.
- install Editor Croutines via Unity's Package Manager, use the command com.unity.editorcoroutines.

> **Note:** Hunyuan3D doesn't run locally on Mac, so you'll need a public API to be able to generate 3D models using our tool.


Once you've imported the library into Unity, you can use the custom editor interface to send prompts to Hunyuan3D for model generation. The editor includes the following fields:

- **Text Prompt**: Enter a detailed description of the object you want to generate. Hunyuan3D supports generating one object at a time. Keep in mind that more complex prompts may increase generation time.
- **API URL**: The endpoint to which Unity will send the request.
- **API Key**: Leave this empty if you're using a local instance of the model.
- **Filename**: Specify the name for the generated model file.
- **Save Path**: Define the folder where the model will be saved. For example, setting this to `3D models` will create or use a folder at `Assets/3D models` in your Unity project.

_(See image for reference to the editor layout.)_


The generated `.glb` file will be saved inside the folder you specified in the **Save Path**.  
You can now use **UniGLTF** to import and use this model directly within your Unity scene.
