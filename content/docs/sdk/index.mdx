The Inventai SDK is a powerful toolkit for creating interactive narrative experiences. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for generating and managing interactive stories, characters, and dialogue.

## Key Components

### Novel Generation

The SDK includes a robust novel generation system that can create branching narratives with multiple paths and endings. The `Novel` class serves as the core component for managing the story structure.

### Character Management

Character interactions are handled through the `CharacterManager` class, which manages character states, relationships, and dialogue options. Characters can have complex personalities and relationships that evolve throughout the story.

### Discussion Context

The `DiscussionContextManager` class maintains the context of ongoing conversations, ensuring continuity and coherence in character interactions. It tracks conversation history and manages the flow of dialogue.

### Export Options

The SDK supports multiple export formats, including:

- Ren'Py script format for visual novel engines
- JSON format for data storage and transfer
- Custom formats through the exporter interface

## Architecture

The SDK follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- Core functionality in the `Inventai` project
- Novel-specific features in the `InventaiNovel` project
- Example implementations in the `InventaiNovelTestApp` project

## Getting Started

To begin using the SDK:

1. Install the required NuGet packages
2. Reference the Inventai and InventaiNovel projects
3. Create a new instance of the `Novel` class
4. Configure your characters and story parameters
5. Generate and export your narrative

## Integrating Hunyuan3D with Inventai

The `ImageAgentHunyuan3D` class serves as a bridge between the Inventai SDK and the Hunyuan3D-2 model generation API. Here's how it works:

#### Purpose

This agent allows you to generate 3D models via prompts or images, integrating seamlessly with the narrative logic of Inventai.

### How It Works

The class uses an internal `HttpClient` to send a POST request to the Hunyuan3D-2 API endpoint. You provide either a **text prompt** or a **base64-encoded image**. Here's what happens:

1. A JSON payload is created using the provided `prompt` or `image`.
2. The payload is serialized using **snake_case** naming conventions for compatibility.
3. The request is sent to the specified endpoint.
4. If successful, the API returns the generated 3D model as a byte array (typically a `.glb` file), which can then be saved or used directly in Unity.

### Example Request

Here's an example of what the JSON payload might look like when sending a text prompt:

```json
{
  "text": "A detailed 3D model of a medieval sword with intricate engravings and a leather-wrapped handle"
}
