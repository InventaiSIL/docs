The InventAI Unity Library lets you generate 3D models and image assets directly in Unity using AI.

## Features

- Generate 3D models from text prompts
- Choose between different models
- Generate image assets and textures
- Use art presets (universe, art style, genre, etc.)
- Create animation sprites from existing images
- Modify existing assets to change your game's look and feel in minutes

## Installation

InventAI Unity Library is a Unity package that can be installed very easily just like any other Unity package. It is available for Windows, Mac and Linux.

1. Download the latest `.unitypackage` from the [InventAI Unity Library releases page](https://github.com/InventaiSIL/library/releases).
2. Open your Unity project.
3. Go to `Assets` > `Import Package` > `Custom Package...` and select the downloaded `.unitypackage` file.
4. Click `Import` to add InventAI to your project.
5. Start using InventAI features in your Unity project!

## Generating image assets

### Requirements

- Unity 2021.3 or newer is recommended.
- You might need to install `Test Framework` and `Editor Coroutines` packages on Unity if you don't have them already.

### Setup

- Start by configuring InventAI in your project settings, by choosing the correct API key and model.
- You can also create custom prompts and art styles, and save them for future use.

### Usage examples

## Generating 3D models

### Requirements

- Have [Hunyuan3D-2](https://github.com/Tencent/Hunyuan3D-2) installed locally or have a public API
- Install [UniGLTF](https://github.com/ousttrue/UniGLTF/releases) plugin on Unity to use 3D `.glb` files
- You might need to install `Test Framework` package on Unity for the UniGLTF plugin to function properly.

> **Note:** Hunyuan3D doesn't run locally on Mac, so you'll need a public API to be able to generate 3D models using our tool.

## Setup

Once you've imported the library into Unity, you can use the custom editor interface to send prompts to Hunyuan3D for model generation. The editor includes the following fields:

- **Text Prompt**: Enter a detailed description of the object you want to generate. Hunyuan3D supports generating one object at a time. Keep in mind that more complex prompts may increase generation time.
- **API URL**: The endpoint to which Unity will send the request.
- **API Key**: Leave this empty if you're using a local instance of the model.
- **Filename**: Specify the name for the generated model file.
- **Save Path**: Define the folder where the model will be saved. For example, setting this to `3D models` will create or use a folder at `Assets/3D models` in your Unity project.

The generated `.glb` file will be saved inside the folder you specified in the **Save Path**.  
You can now use **UniGLTF** to import and use this model directly within your Unity scene.
